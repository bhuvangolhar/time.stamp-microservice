# Timestamp Microservice

This is my first project built on Replit through FreeCodeCamp, using a RESTful API built with the help of Node.js and Express.

# Features

- Accepts a date string or timestamp
- Returns JSON with both Unix and UTC time
- Handles invalid dates gracefully

# Example Output

```json
{"unix": 1451001600000,"utc":"Fri,25 Dec 201500:00:00 GMT"}
```
